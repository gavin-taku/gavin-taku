<h1>Hey, I'm Gavin! 👋 <br/><a href="https://github.com/gavin-taku">Data Scientist</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-gapara">Cybersecurity Enthusiast</a>, <a href="#">Tech Explorer</a></h1>

<h2>💡 About Me</h2>

I’m Gavin Gapara, a Data Science graduate student at Pace University and an IT enthusiast who enjoys turning tech puzzles into practical solutions. Whether it’s building a secure infrastructure, digging through data for insights, or automating home systems, I bring curiosity and a drive to make things *work well and look good doing it.*

Before coming to the U.S., I earned my BTech in Information Technology at the Harare Institute of Technology and sharpened my skills through real-world roles in cybersecurity, IT infrastructure, and software development. My hands-on experience ranges from microwave network installations to building smart homes and analyzing massive datasets.
