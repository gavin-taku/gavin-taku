## 💡 About Me

I’m Gavin Gapara, a Data Science graduate student at Pace University and an IT enthusiast who enjoys turning tech puzzles into practical solutions. Whether it’s building secure infrastructure, digging through data for insights, or automating home systems, I bring curiosity and a drive to make things *work well and look good doing it.*

Before coming to the U.S., I earned my BTech in Information Technology at the Harare Institute of Technology and sharpened my skills through real-world roles in cybersecurity, IT infrastructure, and software development. My hands-on experience ranges from microwave network installations to building smart homes and analyzing massive datasets.
